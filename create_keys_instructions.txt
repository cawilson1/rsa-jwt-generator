First, to generate a JWT using RSA, you'll need a keypair. Make a directory keys, change to it and generate the pair. The keys dir is already in the .gitignore.
Just give me the code (all four commands at once):
mkdir keys && cd keys && openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048 && openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem

Or step by step:
From the root of this repo, make a directory named "keys", and switch to it:
mkdir keys && cd keys
create a rsa key pair using the following commands in a mac or linux cmd line:

Generate Private Key:
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048

Generate Public key from private key:
openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem


The private key will be stored as a secret on the server. The public key will be exposed on an express endpoint.
If the public key can successfully verify the JWT signature hash, this implies that the signature was generated by the private key.
